This project's key aim to carry out sentiment analysis on the tweets associated with this movement (using the above mentioned taglines), and make reasonable, analytical inferences on the impact of the movement since its inception. 
The project deploys top-level Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and architectures to make the best possible predictions on whether tweets (and their implications) are Positive, Negative, or Neutral, the volume of positivity, negativity, or neutrality and the possible implied socialistic meanings [and connotations].
